## Project Description

### Problem Definition

Satisfeed is a cloud-based restaurant app. The client wanted to improve food and service quality, staff team motivation, and CRM/member acquisition. To accomplish these requirements, we developed a platform that included both customer and management facing applications.

### Features

The Satisfeed life cycle includes three stages of user interaction. The app is browser-based and although responsive, it is designed to be used on an Ipad.

### 1. Roster

- Staff roster tool—managers can assign each staff member to kitchen or floor role.

### 2. Feedback & Member Sign-up

- Rating and comments page—during payment/processing, customers can give a rating out of 5 stars for food quality and customer service. Profile photos of staff who are rostered on the day will be displayed at the bottom of the page and customers are able to leave a comment/review.

- Member sign-up form—allows customers to easily become a member to receive exclusive offers through email/posted marketing.

- Member database search tool—allows staff to search quickly for members during customer payment/processing.

### 3. After-sales

- Real-time dashboard—lets managers see weekly kitchen/floor performance on a bart chart.

- Customer comments feed—managers can browse through customer comments with ratings.

- Member/staff management tool—allows managers to create, update and delete staff details.
